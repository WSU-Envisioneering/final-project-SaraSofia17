        <h2>Hello! I'm Sara Sofia</h2>
         <p>Hi! I'm 17 years old, born on July 17, 2008, in BogotÃ¡, Colombia â€” but I was raised my whole life in Santa Marta, a place I love deeply. My favorite place in the world is the beach, and one of my biggest dreams is to have a house by the ocean again, just like when I was little.</p>

    <p>Since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been surrounded by technology, creativity, coffeeâ€¦ and love. I grew up around screens, cables, and designs, inspired by my uncles: one owned a computer repair shop, and the other, who has sadly passed, ran a web and branding company called Arpanet. They taught me to love computers, digital art, and building websites and logos for businesses.</p>

    <p>I also inherited a passion for cars from my stepdad, who raised me since I was a baby. He's a mechanic with his own shop, and I spent lots of time there learning and watching. Iâ€™m a huge fan of cars â€” especially old classics and sporty ones!</p>

    <p>I spent part of my childhood and teen years in Minca, a magical town. There, I rode horses, chased chickens, and instead of making snow angels, I made coffee angels! Being in nature brought me so much joy and shaped who I am.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve also been a model since I was very young, and I continued modeling until the last moment before I left Colombia. Modeling helped me grow confident, expressive, and passionate about fashionâ€”something that still plays a big role in my life.</p>

    <p>I love drawing, painting, doing braids (with or without kanekalon), sewing, knitting, and managing social media pages for small businesses. I also stream on TikTok and Kick, where I play games like Minecraft, Roblox, Warzone, and God of War.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m a very visual person: I love fashion, being well-dressed, and standing out. Iâ€™m passionate, perfectionist, and creative. I love traveling, spending time with my family, shopping, and experiencing new cultures. My favorite colors are elegant dark blue, red, and lately, pastel yellow.</p>

    <p>My favorite flowers are sunflowers, daisies, and tropical coastal flowers. I adore animals â€” especially white tigers, monarch butterflies, and the red-yellow-blue Colombian macaw.</p>

    <p>I speak Spanish and Portuguese, and Iâ€™m currently learning English. I graduated high school in Colombia in 2024 and completed a two-year technical degree in Hospitality and Tourism at SENA.</p>

    <p>Being here in the United States right now is one of my biggest dreams come true. Ever since I was little, I dreamed of studying at a university here. Every time I told my family, they would tell me to have faithâ€”and like magic, last year we finally made it here. For now, Iâ€™m about to start senior year (12th grade), and Iâ€™m closer than ever to achieving that dream.</p>

    <p>I'm a strong believer in God and His power. My journey as an immigrant has brought me closer to Him, especially during hard times. My grandma and my uncle, who are no longer with me, were pillars in my life â€” and I carry everything they taught me in my heart.</p>

    <p>I truly believe that one day Iâ€™ll become someone big, achieve my goals, and live doing what I love. Even when I say I donâ€™t like it, deep down, technology, art, and design are the only things that make me truly happy for hours. And I wonâ€™t stop until I shine.</p>
