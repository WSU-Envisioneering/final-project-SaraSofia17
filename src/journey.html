      <h2>ðŸŒŸ What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        During the Summer Bridge program, especially in WEB 1400, I learned how to create real websites using HTML and CSS. I discovered how to use semantic tags, how to build forms, how to apply styles, and how to organize a site into multiple pages. It was exciting to see my ideas come to life on the screen. I also learned how to use GitHub, how to manage files, and how to work with code in VS Code.

      <h2>ðŸ’­ My Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed the creative freedom to design my own website and express myself. The pastel color schemes and layout building were especially fun. I wish we had more time to explore JavaScript or work on group projects. Overall, the class helped me grow more confident in my abilities, and Iâ€™m proud of what I created.
